# Machine Learning projects and exercises part of curriculum
Several ML projects and exercises I worked on while attending "Applied Data Science: Machine Learning" course at EPFL in Lausanne

## ML key projects description
* **House price prediction** - *"House_prices_vFinal"*
  * Predict house prices through Linear Regression using a real data set with 2'930 observations and 82 variables
  * Includes EDA, Data cleaning, Feature engineering, Feature encoding and modelling fitting using Grid Search
* **Image classifier** - *"Swissroads_..." => split in 9 workbooks due to size and performance limitations*
  * Build an image classifier using *Swissroads* dataset which contains several hundreds images of vehicles found in the EPFL in Lausanne
  * Goal of the project is to test different classifiers and techniques using high-level features extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network from TensorFlow Hub and compare results with own ConvNet implementation trained fomr the raw image pixels
    * classifiers: k-NN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVMs, Keras


## ML exercises description
* **Linear Regression:** - *"Bike_sharing_users"*
  * Bike sharing users - predict number of users each day
* **k-NN:** - *"knn_image_recognition_epfl"*
  * MNIST image recognition
  * CIFAR-10 image recognition (incl. parameters tuning)
* **Logistic Regression:** - *"logreg_heart_disease_diagnosis"*
  * Heart disease diagnosis using grid search and cross-validation
* **Trees and SVMs:**
  * DecisionTree on Titanic data set
  * DecisionTree, RandomForest and SVMs comparison on Spiral data set
* **PCA:**
  * Visualize MNIST
* **Neural Networks**
  * CIFAR-10 Image classification

* *Non-ML projects*
  * *Open Food bank*
  * *World Happiness report*
